# task-cli:  A CLI tool to manage your tasks

## Code
The project uses CMake. There is absolutely zero comments inside the project (bad practice), probably no one can understand this project (I'll probably forget after a week).
## Building
On root, run the following commands:
- `cmake -S . -B build/`
- `cmake --build build/`


The executable should be in build/task-cli.exe.
